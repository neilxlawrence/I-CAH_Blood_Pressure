Now we want to spread the frame, or pivot it wider, so that all labs taken on the same date are on the same line

Remember that the assessment record date might not be the same as the labs date. We always have a visit_date in this frame, but we don't always have a labs_date

what I want to spread is labs_type to make that into a column for each reading, and within that column we want the value of that marker

for this to work, we first need to just pull out the important columns

```{r, manual review of dates in labs frame}
manual_review_visit_data <-
