# I-CAH_Blood_Pressure
Data analysis code for I-CAH Blood Pressure Analysis by Neil Lawrence

This repository contains code used to analyse data from the International Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Registry study 202107_NL

Please note, this repository does not contain patient level data. Patient level data may only be obtained by formal data request from the data controller. Please search 'I-CAH Registry' and apply for patient level data directly from the data controller.

Once patient level data is obtained from the data controller, correct the pathway to the extracted csv file within the code

Also copy the folder bp_functions_folder and it's contents into your main directory 

Create an empty folder 'bp_data_files_to_load' within your main directory

Assess the need for other data files within code and insert these wtihin 'Other Data Extractions' as necessary, dependent upon the form in which your data is provided by the data controller

The files are then designed to be run in order, and will load previously prepared data files. This allows the code to be run separately, as the total run time is long, allowing for any bespoke adjustments to be targeted within specific files
